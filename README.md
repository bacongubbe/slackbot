# Slackbot "Constable Pleasespeakenglishson".

## Background
Working in a multilingual corporate environment can be difficult. Especially when the absolute majority of the staff speak the native language. This can lead to minority sections of the company feeling left out. 

The usual solution for companies that face this situation is to have an "English only" policy in the office and the larger channels in Slack. 

## Problem
Although the solution is good! It can be very difficult for people to always keep it in mind. 

## Solution
This bot is designed to constantly read the channels that it's invited to, react to specific languages that are not English, and remind the person to keep it English. 

## Technology
Slack API and Node.js
